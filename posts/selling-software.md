# What's the problem?

Any problem that requires a company to use software to solve it. 

# What solutions could I provide?

## Skills 
- Web & Cloud Development
- System/Infra Design w/ AWS 

## 1. Prepackaged Repos with AWS & Web App/Middlware Solution

This is something that can be sourced and packaged from seperate repo.
I can build this out in my free time and not pay for hosting. 
- Can be self hosted in containers (in any cloud solution)
- CICD w/ Automated testing
- Packaged with IaaC (AWS CDK)
- No outside network requests so can be secured on isolated environment

## 2. SaaS 

This is a mainstream option because the recurring revenue and if you can keep a customer/subscription long enough, you could get $100+ LTV per customer! This sounds like a passive income dream! The downside is running customer support, feature development, bug development, sales, and every other part of managing an online business; oh and also infrastructure isn't free and you'll be checking your billing reports daily to prevent a run away bill costing you $100s-$1000s. I did this with [payfortime.io](https://github.com/tannerbyers/payfortime) with a cofounder and I'm not interested in doing it part-time. I think it's doable with full time commitment but I have a family and that's not in the cards while I work full time.

## 3. Licensing

This is an option I think that works will with premium features in open source development although this goes against my belief that you should own all software you buy. No license check every month to make sure you still own it. I will not be using this option

## 4.
