## Consulting

I help U.S. healthcare and tech companies solve complex problems with efficient, scalable engineering.

---

### Why Work With Me?

- **Healthcare IT Expertise**  
  With 5+ years in healthcare tech, I’ve worked at scale—from the largest U.S. healthcare clearinghouse to fast-moving startups—navigating legacy systems, EDI workflows, HIPAA, and everything in between.

- **Cloud & Infrastructure Optimization**  
  I use AWS to reduce costs, increase reliability, and simplify infrastructure. Whether it’s a lift-and-shift or full re-architecture, I design systems that scale without stress.

- **Clear, Strategic Process**  
  I apply first-principles thinking to everything from audits to architecture. That means less fluff, more impact—and solutions that make sense for your business and budget. I hate nothing more than useless meetings and projects.
