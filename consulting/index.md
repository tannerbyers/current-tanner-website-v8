## Tech Services

I help healthcare companies and founders solve technical problems with clean, reliable software and efficient infrastructure.

I've been building full-stack applications since 2019 and have worked in healthcare IT for over five years. Iâ€™ve fixed 100's of legacy systems, launched new products, and rebuilt cloud environments for cost and performance. If you need a developer who can handle complexity without wasting time, I can help.

### What I Bring

- **Healthcare Experience**  
  Iâ€™ve worked with large healthcare clearinghouses and startups. I understand HL7, FHIR, HIPAA, and legacy systems. I know where the problems are and how to address them without disrupting what already works.

- **Full-Stack Development**  
  I build applications that are fast, maintainable, and focused on the actual problem. I write clear, well-tested code and structure projects so theyâ€™re easy to improve and scale over time.

- **Cloud Architecture and Cost Reduction**  
  I'm 5x AWS certified. Iâ€™ve redesigned infrastructure, improved reliability, and cut monthly costs for teams that outgrew their original setup or never had one that made sense.
