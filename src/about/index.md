I'm Tanner, a fullstack software engineer sharing what I learn building with AWS and modern web tech.

Started tinkering with Goodwill PC parts in middle school. Taught myself to code during late nights after 12-hour dishwasher shifts.

I've worked at healthcare giants processing billions of transactions (Availity), funded startups (Glidian), and spent two years at AWS Professional Services helping teams build better systems.

## What I've Built

**At AWS** (2022-2024), I developed a React/TypeScript micro-frontend library that saved 100+ developer weeks across 13 teams. Built document repositories that cut search time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds. Designed CloudFormation and IAM policies for AWS JAMs (two of them ranked in the top 10 in 2023).

**In healthcare tech**, debugged processing engines handling 1+ billion transactions monthly, built SOAP API integrations, and created accessibility testing tools that saved hundreds of QA hours.

**Stack**: React, TypeScript, Python, Java, AWS (Lambda, CDK, DynamoDB), Terraform.
