**Serverless Architecture** - Building lean, scalable systems with AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and DynamoDB

**Infrastructure Automation** - Lessons from automating AWS deployments and managing infrastructure as code

**Technical Leadership** - Technical debt, prioritization, and scaling engineering teams

## Audience

I speak to engineering teams, founders, and technical leaders.

## Experience
