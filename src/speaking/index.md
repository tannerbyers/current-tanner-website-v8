# Tech Talks That Don't Put Devs to Sleep.

Full-stack development, AWS, and the future of AI assisted coding. Told by someone who's broken production more than once.

## What I Speak About

### AI in the Dev Workflow (That Actually Works)
How real engineers use AI tools without losing code quality or their jobs.

### Serverless Gone Wild
What AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and DynamoDB can teach you about building lean systems that scale.

### From Scripts to Systems
Lessons from automating AWS deployments before it was cool (and before it worked).

### How to Think Like a CTO Before You Are One
What startups miss about technical debt, prioritization, and people.

## Who I Speak To

I speak to founders and engineering teams who want to ship faster without breaking everything. My talks are technical enough for senior devs and clear enough for PMs who pretend to understand YAML.

## Past Talks

I've presented internally at Amazon on tooling, CI/CD, and AWS best practices. Now I share those lessons with startups and engineering teams ready to scale.
