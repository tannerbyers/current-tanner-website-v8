# Case Studies

Real projects, real results. Here's how I've helped teams get unstuck and ship faster.

## MogulPlex: From Idea to Competition Winner

**Client:** Patrick M., Founder  
**Timeline:** 6 weeks  
**Challenge:** Turn a business concept into a working MVP for a competition

### The Problem
Patrick had a solid business idea but needed a technical co-founder to build the product. With a tight deadline for a business competition, he needed someone who could move fast and deliver quality.

### What I Built
- Full-stack web application with user authentication
- Real-time collaboration features
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Automated testing and deployment pipeline

### Results
> "Tanner helped me go from idea to MVP that won third place in a business competition and got us into an accelerator. I showed up with an idea. He built a product people could use."  
> — **Patrick M., Founder, MogulPlex**

**Outcome:** Third place in competition, accepted into accelerator program

## Healthcare Startup: From Manual Deploys to One-Click Operations

**Client:** Healthcare Web App Startup  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks  
**Challenge:** Stop the deployment horror show and tame runaway AWS costs

### The Problem
Their "deployment process" was a 2-hour ritual involving SSH, prayers, and crossing fingers. AWS bills were climbing 40% month-over-month with no clear reason why. Every deployment was Russian roulette with production.

### What I Fixed
- Built proper Infrastructure as Code with Terraform (goodbye, snowflake servers)
- Set up automated CI/CD with staging that actually mirrors production
- Right-sized AWS resources and eliminated the mystery charges
- Added monitoring that actually tells you what's broken

### Results
- **Deployment time:** 2+ hours of chaos → 8 minutes of calm
- **AWS costs:** Cut by 35% monthly (that's real money back in their pocket)
- **Production fires:** 90% fewer "oh shit" moments
- **Recovery time:** Rollbacks in under 2 minutes instead of all-hands panic

## Enterprise Java Resurrection: When Your Test Suite Takes a Coffee Break

**Client:** Mid-size Software Company  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks  
**Challenge:** Revive a 5-year-old Spring Boot app that everyone was afraid to touch

### The Problem
Their test suite took 45+ minutes to run. Developers would literally go get coffee and hope nothing was broken when they got back. The codebase was a minefield of "works on my machine" and "don't touch that, it might break everything."

### What I Delivered
- Untangled the spaghetti with proper clean architecture
- Made tests actually fast (45 minutes → 8 minutes of sanity)
- Set up automated code standards so everyone writes code the same way
- Documented everything so the next person doesn't have to reverse-engineer it

### Results
- **Test execution:** 82% faster (developers can actually run them now)
- **Development speed:** 40% more features shipped per sprint
- **Bug reports:** Down 60% because the code actually does what it says
- **Developer happiness:** Team finally comfortable making real changes

## Ready to Get Similar Results?

These are just a few examples of how targeted expertise can solve complex problems quickly. Each client had different challenges, but the approach was the same:

1. **Quick audit** to identify the core issues
2. **Focused execution** on highest-impact fixes
3. **Clean handoff** with documentation and knowledge transfer
