# About Me
 <p align="center"> 
 <img width="100%" src="/img/tanner.jpg"/>
 </p> 
 <p><b>TL;DR: </b> I solve complex tech problems (mostly with code). I specialize in modernizing outdated, slow, and expensive systems into scalable, cost-efficient solutions.</p> 
 
 <p>Most of my experience is in the healthcare space, where I’ve worked with companies like <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.availity.com">Availity</a></b> and <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.glidian.com">Glidian</a></b>. I’ve also consulted for a wide range of businesses during my time at <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a></b>.</p>
