I'm Tanner, a fullstack software engineer sharing what I learn building with AWS and modern web tech.

Started tinkering with Goodwill PC parts in middle school. Real learning happened during late nights after 12-hour dishwasher shifts, teaching myself to code. Turns out persistence pays off.

I've worked everywhere from healthcare giants processing billions of transactions (Availity) to funded startups (Glidian), and spent two years on AWS Professional Services helping teams build better systems.

## What I've Built

**At AWS** (2022-2024), I developed a React/TypeScript micro-frontend library that saved 100+ developer weeks across 13 teams. Built document repositories that cut search time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds. Designed CloudFormation and IAM policies for AWS JAMs (two of them ranked in the top 10 in 2023).

**In healthcare tech**, debugged processing engines handling 1+ billion transactions monthly, built SOAP API integrations (yes, they still exist), and created accessibility testing tools that saved hundreds of QA hours.

**The stack**: React, TypeScript, Python, Java, AWS (Lambda, CDK, DynamoDB, all of it), Terraform, and everything else needed to ship reliable software.
