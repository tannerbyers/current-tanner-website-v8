## About Me

 I build websites and work as a software dev/cloud consultant with 5+ years of experience in cloud and full-stack development, specializing in the EDI and the healthcare IT sector. 
 
 I've used Vue, React, Angular, Node.js, Rust and almost all AWS services.

I've designed, developed, deployed and maintained web applications for many enterprise companies like AWS and Availity(nationâ€™s largest health information network), as well as startups like Glidian (Healthcare SaaS)

I also have cofounding PayForTime.io (I cofounded this Appointment Scheduling SaaS) and made tons of personal SaaS under [my github](https://github.com/tannerbyers).
