I’m Tanner, a software developer and cloud consultant. I’ve been building software professionally since 2019, focusing on creating accessible and efficient web applications and optimizing cloud infrastructure.

My interest in tech started in high school during an IT class, but I really began learning in 2015 while working as a dishwasher. I’d finish 12-hour shifts and spend my nights building web apps and writing blog posts. That consistency eventually led to a career where I’ve worked with companies like Availity and Glidian, and consulted for clients during my time at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I specialize in helping founders (mostly at healthcare companies) modernize outdated systems, reduce cloud costs, and build scalable solutions. My approach is straightforward: write clean, well-tested code that solves real problems.

Outside of work, I’m a husband and father of three. My family is my motivation.

If you’re looking for someone to help with your development needs or cloud infrastructure, feel free to reach out.
