# About Me
<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="/img/tanner.jpg"/>
</p>

<p><b>TLDR:</b>I solve problems, mostly in tech. I've worked with lots of outdated, slow, and expensive to maintain systems and help modernize them, making them scalable and cost-efficient.</p>

<p>I've worked at AWS, Availity, and Glidian, and Iâ€™ve consulted for other  companies that needed their tech to actually work for them.

I always love talking shop and figuring out how to make things better. Shoot me an email and we can setup a call!
