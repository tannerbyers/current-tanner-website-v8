# About Me
<p align="center">
<img width="300" src="/img/tanner.jpg"/>
</p>

I've been solving tech problems for 5+ years in corporate america.

<p>I run a <a href="https://www.dxand.com" target= "_blank">healthcare blog</a> (with 2k+ monthly visitors), 
built <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.bassoonai.com">bassoonAI</a> (email template generator), 
PayForTime.io (deprecated - it was like Calendly but for sales reps and you paid for the appointments in advance).

I've worked at <a href="https://www.aws.com" target= "_blank">AWS</a>, <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.availity.com">Availity</a>, and <a href="https://www.glidian.com" target= "_blank">Glidian</a>.</p>

Reach out to me anytime, I check my email daily
