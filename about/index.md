I’m Tanner, a software developer and cloud consultant. I’ve been building software professionally since 2019, focusing on creating accessible and efficient web applications and optimizing cloud infrastructure.

My interest in tech started when I built my first PC from goodwill parts (throwback to when Goodwill still sold used PC's in stores) in middle school. I got introduced to coding in my Intro to Information Technology class but I really began learning in 2015 while I was still a dishwasher. I’d finish 12-hour shifts and spend my nights building web apps and writing blog posts. I did this for years until I got my first dev job and that's led to a career where I’ve worked with all kinds of companies from large corporations (Availity) to funded Startups (Glidian), and consulted for many clients during my time at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I specialize in modernizing outdated systems, reducing cloud costs, and building scalable solutions.
