Hi, I'm Tanner Byers, a software dev/consultant with 5+ years of experience in frontend and full-stack development, specializing in the healthcare IT sector. I've worked with a range of technologies including JavaScript, React, Angular, Node.js, and AWS services.

I've developed and maintained applications for companies like Amazon Web Services and Availity, handling projects such as:

- Creating custom automation scripts and tools.

My goal is to build efficient, scalable solutions.
