I'm Tanner, a full-stack software engineer and AWS consultant with 5 years of professional experience. I've been building things since I was tinkering with Goodwill PC parts in middle school, but the real learning started during those late nights after 12-hour dishwasher shifts.

Turns out persistence pays off. I've since worked everywhere from healthcare giants processing billions of transactions (Availity) to scrappy funded startups (Glidian), and spent two years on AWS Professional Services helping customers build better systems.

## What I've Actually Built

**At AWS** (2022-2024), I developed a React/TypeScript micro-frontend library that saved 100+ developer weeks across 13 teams. I also built document repositories that cut search time from 90 seconds to 15 secondsâ€”because nobody has time to hunt for the right CloudFormation template.

**In healthcare tech**, I've debugged processing engines handling 1+ billion transactions monthly, built SOAP API integrations (yes, they still exist), and created accessibility testing tools that saved hundreds of QA hours.

**The technical stuff**: React, TypeScript, Python, Java, AWS (Lambda, CDK, DynamoDB, the whole stack), Terraform, and all the other acronyms that make things work reliably.

I hold 5 AWS certifications including Security and Database Specialty, because sometimes you need the official stamps to prove you know what you're talking about.
