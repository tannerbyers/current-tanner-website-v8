# About Me
<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="/img/tanner.jpg"/>
</p>

<p><b>TLDR:</b>I solve problems—mostly in healthcare. Mostly deal with outdated, slow, and expensive to maintain systems. I help modernize them, making them scalable and cost-efficient.</p>

<p>I've worked at AWS, Availity, and Glidian, and I’ve consulted for other healthcare companies that needed their tech to actually work for them—not against them.

These days, I also run The Florida Marketer, helping local healthcare businesses get results with digital marketing.

I always love talking shop and figuring out how to make things better. Shoot me an email and we can setup a call!
