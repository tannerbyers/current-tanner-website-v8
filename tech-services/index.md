# Tech Services  
## Your Dev Team Is Stuck. I Can Fix That in a Week.

If your team is smart but slow  
If things keep breaking and no one knows why  
If your deploys, tests, or infra feel fragile or duct-taped together  

You don’t need another dev.  
You need someone who can figure out what’s broken, fix it fast, and get out of the way.

## About Me

**I’m Tanner.**  
I’ve worked with teams at AWS, healthcare clearinghouses, and early-stage startups.

What I’ve done for them:

- Shipped features faster  
- Cleaned up painful tech debt  
- Simplified infra and cut cloud bills  
- Made deploys and pipelines reliable again

I solve high-leverage problems that free up your team to focus on the product.
