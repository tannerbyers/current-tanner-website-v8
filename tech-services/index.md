### Need something fixed now?

- Codebase and deploy pipeline audit: **$1,500**
- Feature or bug delivery in 5 days: **$4,800**
- AWS/Infra cleanup starting at: **$6,000**

Fully async. Fast turnaround. Clean handoff.

If your team is smart but blocked by brittle deployments, slow tests, or AWS bills that make you wince—you don't need another dev. You need someone who's debugged production systems handling billions of transactions and can get you unstuck fast.
