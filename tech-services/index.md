[Jump to full services ↓](#what-i-offer)

If your team is smart but needs help with workflows or infra  
If things keep breaking and no one knows why  
If your deploys, tests, or infra feel fragile or duct-taped together  

You don’t need another dev.  
You need someone who can figure out what’s broken, fix it fast, and get out of the way.

## What I Offer

### Dev Audit — $1,500  
<small>Timeline: 1–2 days</small>

A full async review of your:

- Codebase + repo structure  
- CI/CD pipeline  
- Infra setup (AWS, Terraform, etc)

**You’ll get:**

- A short video walkthrough  
- A PDF report with the top 3–5 fixes  
- A risk score and action plan  
- Async Q&A access after delivery

Perfect if you’re stuck and not sure why.

<b>If I audit your code and infra and find nothing worth fixing, I’ll refund the full fee.</b>

### 1-Week Sprint — $4,800  
<small>Timeline: 5 business days</small>

You hand me a feature, bug, or friction point. I handle:

- Scoping  
- Testing  
- Building  
- Delivery + docs

**You stay focused. I ship the fix.**  
No meetings. No micromanagement.

---

### Infra Modernization — Starting at $6,000

Refactor and streamline your cloud setup.  
I’ll come in, clean it up, and hand it back documented.

Typical outcomes:

- Faster deploys  
- Lower AWS bills  
- Cleaner Terraform  
- Working alerts and rollback  
- No more flaky tests or mystery downtime
